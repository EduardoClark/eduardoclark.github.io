<p align="justify">Welcome to my blog. I'm pretty excited to be writing the first entry for this and I expect I should be able to provide some interesting posts in the future. First of all I would like to introduce myself a bit. </p>

<p align="justify">My name is Eduardo Clark. I a 24 year old political scientist/economist based out of Mexico City, although originally from the mexican state of Guanajuato. For the past two years I've been lucky enough to work at <a href="http://imco.org.mx">IMCO </a> a public policy think tank here in Mexico City. My work at IMCO mainly focuses on crime and violence in Mexico and the impact this has on the mexican economy.</p>
