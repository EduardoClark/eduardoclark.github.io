<p align="justify"> For the past few months or so I've been playing around with Mexicos's homicide database. Every month (around the 15th) the national public safety system <a href="http://www.secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/">(SNSP)</a> releases information regarding the number of crimes commited in Mexico, this information comes from the local (state) district attorney's office who compile information about the number of crimes commited for something like 10 or so different fellonies and then submit it to the SNSP who publishes the data at the state and national level. Due to the constant release of data, this particular database proves particularly useful for government reporting about the state of public safety in the country for a particular month. Nevertheless consecutive month comparison may not be possible because not all months are create equal (I'll explain further in the next paragraphs). So me and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ahope71">Alejandro Hope</a> at IMCO decided it could be good idea to create a database that we could compare easily with anyother month of the database (which runs from 1997 to the present). </p>
