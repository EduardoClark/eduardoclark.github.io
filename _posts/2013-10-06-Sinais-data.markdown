<p align="justify"> Recently I was approached by one of Mexico's most popular sport websites, <a href="http://www.mediotiempo.com/" target="_blank">MedioTiempo.com</a> with a question. Does football increase violence and criminal incidence? One of the things they wanted to know was if first division football (<a href="http://www.ligamx.net/index.html" target="_blank"> Liga MX</a>) games in Mexico altered the number of crimes commited in the home city of the playing team. Right away I though this was a really good question and started mindstorming about some possible ways to find out. This post is about one idea I had to test for this and the results I found. Hopefully a cooler and more visual post will come out soon at mediotiempo.com.</p>
