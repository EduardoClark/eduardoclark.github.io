<p align="justify"> Lately I've been working a couple of projects that involved cellphone use in Mexico. As soon as we started working we identified the clear lack of information about where coverage exists in Mexico and where it doesn't. In particular we wanted to identify locality level information on cellphone coverage and at the end of the day we found out that either you went directly with the carriers or you didn't have acess to easy to use information.</p>

<p align="justify"> The closest we found was <a href="http://opensignal.com/" target="_blank">Open Signal</a> which provides an API from a crowdsourced database on signal in different parts of Mexico.  <p>

 <a href="http://www.mediotiempo.com/" target="_blank">MedioTiempo.com</a> with a question. Does football increase violence and criminal incidence? One of the things they wanted to know was if first division football (<a href="http://www.ligamx.net/index.html" target="_blank"> Liga MX</a>)

<p align="justify"> Due to the quality and availability of data the only way possible (that I could think of) was restricting the analysis to only include homicides, this mostly due to the fact that no criminal incidence data in Mexico is dissagregated to the daily level. I considered that the most useful dataset for this task was Mexico's mortality database (<a href="http://www.sinais.salud.gob.mx/basesdedatos/std_defunciones.html" target="_blank">SINAIS</a>) that is released yearly by INEGI. This dataset includes all registered deaths in Mexico since 1998 (and through 2011 as of september 2013)  at the death certificate level. This allows for the creation of daily homicide counts for every city or metropolitan area with first division football. For the game data I scrapped several mexican sport websites that included information about the teams involved, the date, location and results of the game. I was able to compile the complete set of mexican first division football games for the years 2007-2013. After merging the two datasets the results was a 29,234 observations panel dataset that included homidice counts for every day between 2007 and 2011 for the 16 mexican cities that have had first division football teams in this period. Table 1 summarizes the number of observations by day of the week and if they had games or not. Table 2 shows the total number of game days for each of the metropolitan areas. </p>
