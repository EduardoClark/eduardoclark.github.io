<p align="justify"> For the past few months or so I've been playing around with Mexicos's homicide database. Every month (around the 15th) the national public safety system <a href="http://www.secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/">(SNSP)</a> releases information regarding the number of crimes commited in Mexico, this information comes from the local (state) district attorney's office who compile information about the number of crimes commited for something like 10 or so different fellonies and then submit it to the SNSP who publishes the data at the state and national level. </p>

<p align="justify">Due to the constant release of data, this particular database proves particularly useful for government reporting about the state of public safety in the country for a particular month. Nevertheless consecutive month comparison may not be possible because not all months are created equal (I'll explain further in the next paragraphs). So <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ahope71" target="_blank">Alejandro Hope (follow him on twitter!!) </a> and me at IMCO decided it could be good idea to create a database that we could compare easily with any other month of the database (which runs from 1997 to the present). We chose to focus our efforts on the homicide (intentional) time series. We chose this particular series for a couple of very simple reasons. Homicide is probably the crime with the lowest under reportment rate (which should in theory also render it the most consistent in the database), and it's certainly the most serious crime, which should then help us assess the state of public safety better than the other available crimes. </p>

<p align="justify"> First of all, why should we expect marked monthly differences in crime rates? Well the first reason is that different months have a different number of days. So, even at the same rate of homicides per day, consecutive months can vary around 3% without real changes in the underlying situation. This is even more serious in the case of february which, at current numbers, can have about 150 more homicides than january or march at the same average number of homicides per day. But then, why not use average homicides per day as our benchmark? Well it might also be that the number of days per month doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

<p align="justify"> Seasonal Factors </p>

<p align="justify"> We knew of a series of techniques that are used to remove these ciclical factors from time series, this is a procedure known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment" target="blank"> seasonal adjustment</a>. Firstly we had to visually inspect the series to look for marked differences between months, so we built a seasonal factors graph by period. This graph helps us see how the number of homicides for a particular month varies from the yearly mean and also how this variation changes over time  </p>
