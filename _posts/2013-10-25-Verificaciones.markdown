<p align="justify"> This shouldn't be a very interesting post, it's just about a really quick webtool that explored how certain vehicles did in emissions testing depending on model year. This is part of the results a contest I was kindly invited by Pepe Merino, one of my college professors, in which the Laboratorio para la Ciudad, which heads Mexico City's open data inciative, prereleased local datasets and gave us 24 hours to produce a data journalism project.</p> 

<p align="justify"> My team included two people from the lab for the city, a designer and a computer programmer, we had brilliant starting idea but that got vetoed (ironic right) so did this. Hope you like it.</p>

You can find the full site we created <a href="http://eduardoclark.github.io/verificaciones/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p align="justify"> Here you can see a sneak peak on one of our d3.js visualizations. Basically it shows the 200 vehicle models that have the most vehicles emissions tests. The size of the bubble is how many tests per model and the color shows if the approve the test or fail it, the greener it is the better they do and conversely the redder the bubble the worse they do.</p>
