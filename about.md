## Hello


I'm Eduardo. Originally most of my work was about crime and violence in Mexico, mainly  that related to drug trafficking. My main interest is illegal drug markets so you should expect most of my posts to be about that. Lately I've dabled into other areas of research so you might find more diverse posts now.

Until recently was a researcher and head data scientist at [IMCO](http://www.imco.org.mx), a Mexico City based public policy think tank. But now I'm a bureaucrat at the Office of the President of Mexico where I head a little data science lab for evidence based policy making, or something like that.
